# Data-Science-Group-Report
This is a Data Science Group report on a project I wrote while enrolled at the University of Western Ontario.
For this project, my team members and I investigated PGA Tour data. 

We used Data Science techniques to try and obtain a model that would determine if a golfer would make or miss the cut on the PGA Tour.
Our methodology and findings are documented in this report, our best model had an AUC score of 0.64.
